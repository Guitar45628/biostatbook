        120 participants (aged 40-65 years) with stage 1 or 2 hypertension were randomized to either a plant-based 
        diet intervention (n=60) or standard diet control group (n=60) for 12 weeks. Blood pressure was measured at 
        baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Results showed a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure in the 
        intervention group (-8.4 mmHg, p<0.01) compared to the control group (-1.2 mmHg, p=0.45). Similar trends were 
        observed for diastolic blood pressure. Multiple regression analysis controlling for age, BMI, and baseline 
        medication use confirmed the independent effect of the dietary intervention (Œ≤=-7.2, p<0.01). These findings 
        suggest that a plant-based diet may be an effective non-pharmacological approach for blood pressure management
